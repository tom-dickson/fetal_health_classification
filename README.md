# Fetal health classification project

This repository contains my work in analyzing the Fetal Health Classification dataset I found on Kaggle (at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification).
The data.py file contains code where I collect and explore the data, select features, and resample to correct the large imbalance
in the original dataset. Then, classification.py contains my implementation of a Gaussian naive Bayes algorithm for classifying fetal health
based on the monitored health signals. 

Going forward, I may look in to other classification strategies and do some hyperparameter tuning to see if the performance of the 
model can be improved further.
